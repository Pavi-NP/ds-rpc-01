# FinSolve RBAC Chatbot

### Overview

The FinSolve RBAC Chatbot is an intelligent, secure assistant developed for FinSolve Technologies. It empowers teams to quickly access the information they need, tailored to their specific roles. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), the chatbot delivers personalized and reliable responses sourced directly from department-specific documents, including financial reports, technical documentation, HR policies, and more.

### Key Features
**•	Role-Based Access Control:** Fine-grained document access, customized for each department.<br>
**•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines vector search with large language models for context-rich answers.<br>
**•	Natural Language Interface:** Ask questions in plain English and receive clear responses.<br>
**•	Source-Aware Answers:** Every response includes source references for transparency.<br>
**•	Interactive Chat UI:** Real-time chat interface for seamless communication.<br>
**•	JWT Authentication:** Secure login and session management.<br>

### Role-Based Access Matrix

</div>

**Key:**
   •	✅ = Access granted (number indicates accessible files)<br>
   •	❌ = Access denied

This matrix shows how document access is restricted based on organizational roles, ensuring sensitive documents are only accessible to authorized teams. C-Level executives have full access, while other teams see only their department's documents and general docs.

### Installation
**1.Set Up Your Environment:** <br>
Clone the repository:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cd your-repo-name<br>

**2.Create and activate a virtual environment:** <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;python -m venv venv<br>

#### On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
#### On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate


**3.Install dependencies:**
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure requirements.txt exists in your root directory, then run:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
   
**4.Configure Environment Variables** <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a .env file in your project root with sensitive info:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key<br>
   
**5. Run the Application** <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;(Replace app.main:app with your actual FastAPI app path)<br>
   
**6. Access the Application** <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Open your browser and navigate to:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;**http://127.0.0.1:8000/** to view the main interface.<br>
     
### Security Highlights<br>
**•	JWT Authentication:** Secure login and session management.<br>
**•	Role-Based Filtering:** Results are filtered according to user roles.<br>
**•	Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse and overload.<br>

### Future Enhancements<br>
**•** Support for PDF, TEXT, and DOC files (including the implementation of code to handle these file types — already completed).<br>
**•** Enable switching between different Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude 3 and LLaMA 3.<br>
**•** Implement enhanced security measures with username and ID verification.<br>
**•** Develop an admin dashboard for managing roles and documents.<br>
**•** Add CSV export functionality for structured data.<br>
**•** Integrate LangChain with an SQL database for advanced querying and structured answer generation.<br>
**•** Ensure secure password storage by utilizing PBKDF2-HMAC hashing algorithms. <br>

# DS RPC 01: Internal chatbot with role based access control

This is the starter repository for Codebasics's [Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-gen-ai-data-science-resume-project-challenge) of building a RAG based Internal Chatbot with role based access control. Please fork this repository to get started.

Basic Authentication using FastAPI's `HTTPBasic` has been implemented in `main.py` for learners to get started with.
